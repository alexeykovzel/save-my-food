# SaveMyFood
SaveMyFood is a cross-platform mobile application for grocery management. it keeps track of expiration dates and notifies the user whenever a product is about to expire.

### For Android users

First, download flutter from here: https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install. 
Then, to build an APK for Android, run the following command:
```
sh apk-build.sh
```
The launcher will be located at:
save_my_food/build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-armeabi-v7a-release.apk

### For IOS users

Unfortunately, I need MacOS to build for IOS :(
